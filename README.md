# Introduction

**Systems design** is the process of defining the [architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_architecture), modules, interfaces, and [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data) for a [system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System) to satisfy specified [requirements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirement). Systems design could be seen as the application of [systems theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory) to [product development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_development). There is some overlap with the disciplines of [systems analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_analysis), [systems architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_architecture) and [systems engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_engineering).

### Background

If the broader topic of [product development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_development) "blends the perspective of marketing, design, and manufacturing into a single approach to product development," then design is the act of taking the marketing information and creating the design of the product to be manufactured. Systems design is therefore the process of defining and developing [systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System) to satisfy specified [requirements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirement) of the user.

The basic study of system design is the understanding of component parts and their subsequent interaction with one another.

  <summary><b>Traffic Cop - Learn Load Balancer using HAProxy</b></summary>


  ```
  How does Google manage to respond to our query within seconds? Good question! 
  Most users of the web are unaware of the sheer scale of the search engine 
  responsible for bringing content across the Internet. The boom in the digital 
  revolution has resulted in increased usage of the Internet with Google facing the 
  heat of the increasing demand in terms of million requests per second to serve 
  their loyal customers.

  Sites like Google which bring in high-volume traffic may inadvertently be faced 
  with frequent server upgrades, so that page speed and, in turn, usability, doesnâ€™t 
  suffer for their loyal customers. Often, however, simple hardware upgrades arenâ€™t 
  enough to handle the vast traffic that some sites draw.

  So how do Google ensures that it wonâ€™t burst into figurative flames as page visits 
  skyrocket? The concept of Load Balancing comes into picture.

  <summary><b>Exploring Content Delivery Network</b></summary>


  ```
  Entertainment content has always had humans hooked from the very beginnings of 
  mankind. We all love to binge watch web series like Breaking Bad, Money Heist, 
  Stranger things, The Boys, Scam 1992 etc on respective platforms like Netflix, 
  Amazon Prime, Sony Liv,etc. Did it ever occured in our mind how the OTT platorm are 
  able to provide their content so blazingly fast without any interruption across the 
  globe ?

  The Internet is a constantly-changing mechanism, and new forms of data and content 
  are constantly being created. Soon after it was made commercially available, the 
  problem of pushing massive amounts of data to the end user as fast as possible had 
  to be solved. **Enter CDNs.**

  <summary><b>Exploring Caching</b></summary>


  ```
  When hearing the word **Cache** the first thing that comes into normal peopleâ€™s 
  mind is money, but what all the Computer Geeks hear and understand is a place where 
  computer stores recently used information.

  To respect the sentiments of the Computer Geeks, let's define it in a standard 
  course of action given below:-

  > *Caching* refers to the use of a faster medium to prevent a slower medium from 
  slowing down the performance of a computer.

  Certain components, like the CPU, have a small amount of physical cache memory 
  built into them so that they can quickly access the information they need, rather 
  than waiting for the information to be sent to them through the busses.

  In this microbyte, we will commence by a small Case Study of Caching in real life 
  so the laymen can relate to it, learn LRU Algorithm through visual representation ( 
  *talk less show more* ) methodology, and explore the application of cache in 
  computer system like Linux Page Cache and DNS Cache. 

  ```
