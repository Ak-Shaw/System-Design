# Introduction

**Systems design** is the process of defining the [architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_architecture), modules, interfaces, and [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data) for a [system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System) to satisfy specified [requirements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirement). Systems design could be seen as the application of [systems theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory) to [product development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_development). There is some overlap with the disciplines of [systems analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_analysis), [systems architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_architecture) and [systems engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_engineering).

### Background

If the broader topic of [product development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_development) "blends the perspective of marketing, design, and manufacturing into a single approach to product development," then design is the act of taking the marketing information and creating the design of the product to be manufactured. Systems design is therefore the process of defining and developing [systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System) to satisfy specified [requirements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirement) of the user.

The basic study of system design is the understanding of component parts and their subsequent interaction with one another.
